A classic game of two 'tic-tac-toe'.

The tic-tac-toe game is for two players. One player plays X and the other plays O. The players take turns placing their marks on a grid of three-by-three cells. If a given player gets three marks in a row horizontally, vertically, or diagonally, then that player wins the game. The game will be tied if no one gets three in a row by the time all the cells are marked.


This is a simple implementation using HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
Have fun and may the best player win!
